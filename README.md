# VBA-Challenge
# During this challenge I was require to sort through a data set containing stock tickers and their coresponding open and close price on a given date.
# Using a Macro I then completed the following steps: 
* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.
  
 # I also used some conditional formatting in order to fill the cells with a designated color depending on the outcome
 # In the bonus section I as asked to:

# Create a solution that will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume". The solution will look as follows:

# Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

# This code had to run through multiple worksheets in a given workbook
